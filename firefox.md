## 1.2. Extensions

### 1.2.1. Firefox Multi-Account Containers

The [Firefox Multi-Account Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/nl/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/) extension lets you carve out a separate box for each of your online lives – no more opening a different browser just to check your work email! Here is a quick video showing you how it works.

Under the hood, it separates website storage into tab-specific Containers. Cookies downloaded by one Container are not available to other Containers. With the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension, you can...

- Sign in to two different accounts on the same site (for example, you could sign in to work email and home email in two different Container tabs.
- Keep different kinds of browsing far away from each other (for example, you might use one Container tab for managing your Checking Account and a different Container tab for searching for new songs by your favorite band)
- Avoid leaving social-network footprints all over the web (for example, you could use a Container tab for signing in to a social network, and use a different tab for visiting online news sites, keeping your social identity separate from tracking scripts on news sites)

### 1.2.2. FoxyProxy
