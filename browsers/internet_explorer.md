# Internet Explorer

Projects which still need to be supported in Internet Explorer can be easily tested and simulated in the browser on Windows. By going into the developer tools you can find the simulation tool in the top right. In this dropdown you can go all the way back to IE5 to simulate how any website looks and works in this legacy browser.
